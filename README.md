# Student Directory 2 #

The Student Directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at
Villians Academy.

This is a practice tutorial, creating a command line app,
to highlight the Ruby code that is needed along with teaching the process
of creating a project from scratch.

Student Directory was my first attempt at a command line app, a task set by Makers Academy (the bootcamp I am enrolled in) in week 4 of the Precourse.

After completing the tutorial the first time round, I wished to practice and develop a deeper
understanding of creating a command line app by going through each step again attempting as much 
as I could from memory. Student Directory 2 was created for the purpose of learning/studying Ruby.

Please look to student-directory for first draft of the tutorial with exercises.

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby directory.rb 
```

To load data from students.csv file:

```shell
ruby directory.rb students.csv
````
